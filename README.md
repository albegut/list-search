# Title of the sample

> This is how you want the sample to appear in the samples browser.
> When naming your sample, try to give it a friendly name that describes what it does. Avoid using terms like `SharePoint` and `WebPart` -- because that's what all the samples in this repo is all about. Also, don't use `React`, `Angular`, `JavaScript`, etc. in your sample title -- unless that's what the sample is about.
